# Heart-Disease-Prediction Using ML and Python
Heart Disease Prediction using ML and Python .This project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing by Using several ML models.I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
